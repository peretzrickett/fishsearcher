Catch and release is a practice many anglers follow to help preserve fish populations. When practicing catch and release, it's important to handle the fish as little as possible. Use barbless hooks to minimize injury to the fish. Always wet your hands before handling the fish to protect their slime coat. Gently return the fish to the water as soon as possible to ensure its survival.
