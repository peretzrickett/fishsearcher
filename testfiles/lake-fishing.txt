Lake fishing is a popular pastime for many anglers. When fishing in a lake, it's important to understand the type of fish you're targeting. Bass, for example, can often be found near underwater structures. It's also crucial to have the right bait. Worms, minnows, and artificial lures can all be effective. Patience is key when lake fishing, as fish are not always eager to bite.
